In the quiet, humming belly of the starship Luna Voyager, two children began to stir from a long, dreamless sleep. Max and his little sister, Ellie, had been placed into cryo-sleep for what felt like only a moment—but in truth, they had slept for over a hundred years, traveling across the stars.

With a soft hiss, the glass pods opened, and the children blinked as the cool air brushed their faces. Max rubbed his eyes and sat up. The room was filled with gentle blue lights and the soft hum of machinery. Ellie yawned, her tiny hands stretching toward the ceiling of the cryo bay.

"Where are we?" she mumbled sleepily.

Max glanced around and spotted a screen flickering to life on the wall. The familiar face of Scout, the ship’s friendly AI, appeared. “Good morning, Max. Good morning, Ellie,” it said in a warm voice. “You’re now approaching your new home—Planet Aurora."

Planet Aurora! Max’s heart raced. He had heard stories about it before they left Earth, a place with glowing trees and floating rivers, where the sky was every color of the rainbow.

"We made it!" Max said, his eyes wide with excitement. Ellie, still half asleep, gave a sleepy smile. "Does that mean we can go exploring now?" she asked with a yawn.

Scout chuckled softly. "Soon, Ellie. First, you’ll need to get ready for your adventure."

Max and Ellie hopped out of their pods and followed the glowing lines on the floor that led to the main deck. As they walked, Scout told them about all the amazing things waiting for them on Aurora.

"The trees on Aurora are as tall as skyscrapers, and they glow in the dark like giant lanterns," Scout explained. "And if you're lucky, you might even see a Starwhale swimming in the sky."

Ellie’s eyes widened. “A Starwhale? What’s that?”

"It’s a giant creature that sails through the clouds, its fins glittering like stardust," Scout said. "They're very rare, but with your explorer skills, I’m sure you’ll spot one."

When they arrived at the observation deck, the children gasped. Outside the giant windows, the planet Aurora came into view, shimmering with hues of blue, green, and purple. The atmosphere glowed softly, and they could already see the tops of those famous glowing trees.

Max squeezed Ellie’s hand. "We really made it."

As the ship prepared to land, Scout spoke once more. “Now, remember, your mission is to explore and discover new things. But most importantly—have fun! You’re the first children to ever set foot on this planet.”

The landing was smooth, and soon Max and Ellie were stepping out of the ship, their feet crunching softly on the sparkling grass beneath them. The air smelled sweet, like fresh rain mixed with something magical.

Ellie looked up at Max with a grin. “Let’s go find a Starwhale!”

And so, with hearts full of wonder and excitement, Max and Ellie set off into the glowing forest, ready to explore their new world. The adventures that awaited them on Planet Aurora were endless—full of secret caves, flying creatures, and hidden treasures—because in this new home among the stars, the possibilities were as infinite as the universe itself.

And as they walked deeper into the glowing woods, Ellie whispered, “I think this is going to be the best adventure ever.”
